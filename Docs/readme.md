# Commands

Use exe!help for list of all commands registerd in the bot!

# Run Examples

To use the `exe!run` command to make a command it is needed to specify ur language you want to run.

Specifying ur language :

To specify your language you need to use the language codes from the bot's system 

```
Bash = bh
Python = py
Java = jav
Php = php
rust = rst
Typescript = ts
Elixir = exs 
Swift = swift
Lua = lua 
GoLang = go 
Erlang = erlang 
Lolcode = lolcode
```

So the correct way to do it is to NEVER put the language codes in the code blocks! because it will result in an error. Example
